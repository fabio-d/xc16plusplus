# Example C++ project

This folder contains a simple LED-blinking project that shows how to invoke the
C++ compiler from a GNU Makefile, how to mix C and C++ source files in a project
and how to write in C++ for PIC24/dsPIC chips. All code in this folder is
released to public domain (see *LICENSE-UNLICENSE.txt* in the parent directory),
so you can use it as starting point for your projects.

## Compiling and running the project
 1. Edit the first lines of the *Makefile* to set your target chip.
 2. Set `XC16DIR` in the *Makefile* to your XC16/XC16++ installation directory.
 3. If necessary, edit *clock.c*, `FCY` in *clock.h* and the `#pragma config`
    section in *main.cpp* to adapt them to your chip.
 4. Run `make` in this directory.
 5. If no errors occur, *result.hex* will be created. Otherwise, run
    `make clean`, go back to point 1 and double-check.
 6. Flash the HEX file. For example, if you use the PICkit 2 programmer with a
    dsPIC33FJ128MC804:
    <pre>pk2cmd -PdsPIC33FJ128MC804 -Fresult.hex -M -R</pre>
